# Ocean_cleanup

Ocean is among the earthâ€™s most valuable natural resources, but also the end point for severe pollution caused by humans. Since ocean cleanup is costly and time consuming, efficient resources distribution is crucial to continue the community's effort and maximize cleanup activity results. In this research, we focus on analyzing and predicting human resource allocation, given trashload and location statistics. We measure the effect of state-wise population increase in the US on marine pollution, predict the number of people needed for ocean cleanup, and optimize resource allocation using machine learning algorithms. We implemented various approaches such as: XGBoost and generalized linear models. The performance of each method will be evaluated by computing the errors between the predicted resources and the ground-truth resources on a held-out dataset. Ultimately, the prediction model can be interpreted as part of a resource recommendation system that will be potentially helpful for environmentalists to optimize human resource recruitment in their campaigns. We hope that our project can speak volumes of what measures need to be taken to tackle publicly available resources that eventually assist in creating a balanced ecosystem for land and marine species in the future, as well as encourage further environmental research.
